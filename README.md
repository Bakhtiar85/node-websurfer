# Social Media Bot for LinkedIn Interactions

This project is a social media bot designed to automate likes, comments, and other interactions on LinkedIn posts using Puppeteer. It interacts with company posts, using credentials and other settings provided in the `.env` file. The bot leverages Puppeteer stealth mode to avoid detection and simulates user activity on the LinkedIn platform.
